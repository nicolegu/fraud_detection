# Fraud Detection

This project aims to use random forest and xgBoost to predict fraudulent online transactions. A common issue with fraud detection using supervised learning is that the data we have is highly imbalanced. More specifically, the majority of transactions in data are normal (labeled as 0) while fraud transactions (labeled as 1) only account for less than 20% of the data. When we train a supervised machine learning model, the model tends to predict a transaction is normal, because the data has too few positive cases for the model to learn. We also need to be careful about model evaluation. For example, we should not focus only on accuracy, because even if the model predicts all transactions are normal, it will still achieve a high accuracy score given the fraud transactions are so rare. In this project, I will use the SMOTE method to oversample the minority class and to create a balanced dataset. I will compare the confusion matrix, precision, and recall to check if the true positive rate rises and the false negative rate decreases.
